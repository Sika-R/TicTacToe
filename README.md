# TicTacToe
A m, n, k-game written in C++ using console.

Currently it works as a tictactoe game. Unfortunately it does not parse command line parameters at the time. To change the parameters of the game, you'll have to go to main function and change the params of Game, then recompile.

To make a play, input x, y to the command line. If the input cannot be parsed, the program will ask you to input again.

To undo, input undo to the command line. The game will revert to its last status.
